# Yandex.Music project
## Analysis of user behavior in Moscow and St. Petersburg

**The project task** is to use real Yandex.Music data with the help of Pandas library and its capabilities to verify the data and compare the behavior and preferences of users of two capitals - Moscow and St. Petersburg. The following three hypotheses were formulated:

1. User activity depends on the day of the week. And in Moscow and St. Petersburg this manifests itself differently.
2. On Monday morning in Moscow some genres prevail, and in St. Petersburg other genres prevail. Similarly, on Friday evening, different genres prevail, depending on the city.
3. Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow they listen more often to pop music, in St. Petersburg to Russian rap.

As part of the study, they were tested after preprocessing and baseline examination of the data. <br><br>
