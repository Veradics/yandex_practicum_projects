# Tariff recommendation

**The main task of the project** was to solve a *binary classification* problem: to learn to predict the appropriate tariff (*Smart or Ultra*) for users based on data about the behavior of customers who have already made a choice. The data was provided in pre-processed form.

The project consists of two parts. The first one includes data preparation and exploration. The second part covers consideration of several classifiers, selection of optimal hyperparameters and validation of the most "successful" model on a test set.
