# Hotel cancellation prediction

**The project task** is to develop a system that predicts the rejection of hotel room reservations, aiming to minimize revenue loss. The approach involves building a model that forecasts cancellations, prompting potentially unreliable customers to pay a deposit.

Project phases include data preprocessing, profit estimation, model development and also defining unreliable customer characteristics. To cope with the imbalance of classes in the target the positive class sample was synthetically increased using the SMOTE technique. <br><br>
