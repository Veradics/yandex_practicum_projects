# Accident risk assessment

**The main objective of the project** is to create a system that could assess the risk of an accident along a selected traffic route. Risk is defined as the probability of an accident with any damage to the vehicle. Once the driver has booked the vehicle, got behind the wheel and selected the route, the system should assess the risk level. If the risk level is high, the driver will see a warning and route recommendations. 

The solution is based on customer's idea and includes loading data from database, statistical analysis of road traffic accident factors, data preprocessing and building the ML models. <br><br>
