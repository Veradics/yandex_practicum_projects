# Comment classification
## Search for toxic comments

**The main goal of the project** is to create a model that can categorize comments into positive and negative. **Customer** is an online store that is launching a new service that allows you to edit and complete product descriptions like in wiki communities. The store needs a tool that will search for toxic comments and send them for moderation. 

The project includes all the major steps of a basic NLP project, including tokenization, removing stopwords, lemmatization and text vectorization using TF-IDF. <br><br>
