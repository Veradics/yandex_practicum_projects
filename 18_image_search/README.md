# Image search
## Development of a demo version of image search by query

**The main task of the project** is to develop a demo version of image search by query. It was necessary to train a model that will receive a vector representation of the image, a vector representation of the text, and output a number from 0 to 1 to show how well the text and the image fit together. 

Images containing pictures of children and teenagers, which could lead to legal implications, were removed. The ResNet50 model pre-trained on imagenet was used for image vectorization, and TF-IDF technology was used for text vectorization. <br><br>
